# Research-on-Female-Oriented-Mobile-Games-Based-on-Multi-Model-Attribution

# Overview
This project builds multi-models to analyze and predict user acquisition and retention in female-oriented mobile games using global market data.  The goal is to identify which product and operational features matter most, and how their impact changes over the user lifecycle.

# Data

Based on aggregated, non-user-level mobile game market data collected from publicly available industry analytics sources.

The dataset represents a global snapshot of the female-oriented mobile gaming market during the mature competition phase and is used exclusively for research and modeling purposes.

# Methods

Data cleaning & attribute reduction

Categorical encoding (dummy variables)

Median-based target binarization

Stratified train/test split (80/20)

Multi-model training & evaluation

Cross-model feature importance comparison

# Models Used

Random Forest – main attribution model

Gradient Boosted Trees – performance benchmark

Logistic Regression – effect direction validation

Naive Bayes – baseline comparison

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall
